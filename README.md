## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/getting-started/create-next-app).
It uses the [`@react-google-maps/api`](https://github.com/JustFly1984/react-google-maps-api) package for Google Maps integration.

The API Key can be found in the shared [Bitwarden vault](https://warden.twaslowski.com).
